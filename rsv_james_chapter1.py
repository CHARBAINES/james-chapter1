                        'Christ, To the twelve tribes \n  in the Dispersion: '
                        'Greeting.',
                        2: '2.Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet '
                        'various trials,',
                        3: '3.for you know that the testing of your faith '
                        'produces steadfastness.',
                        4: '4.And let steadfastness have its full effect, '
                        'that you may be perfect and complete, \n  lacking in '
                        'nothing',
                        5: '5.If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, '
                        'who gives to all men generously and \n  without '
                        'reproaching, and it will be given him.',
                        6: '6.But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for '
                        'he who doubts is like a wave of \n  the sea that is '
                        'driven and tossed by the wind.',
                        7: '7.For that person must not suppose that',
                        8: '8.a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways, '
                        'will receive anything from the Lord.',
                        9: '9.Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,',
                        10: '10.and the rich in his humiliation, because like '
                        'the flower of the grass he will \n  pass away.',
                        11: '11.For the sun rises with its scorching heat and '
                        'withers the grass; its flower falls, \n  and its beauty '
                        'perishes. So will the rich man fade away in the midst '
                        'of his pursuits.',
                        12: '12.Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when '
                        'he has stood the test he will receive the \n  crown of '
                        'life which God has promised to those who love him.',
                        13: '13.Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am '
                        'tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted with \n  evil '
                        'and he himself tempts no one;',
                        14: '14.but each person is tempted when he is lured '
                        'and enticed by his own desire.',
                        15: '15.Then desire when it has conceived gives birth '
                        'to sin; and sin when it is full-grown \n  brings forth '
                        'death.',
                        16: '16.Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.',
                        17: '17.Every good endowment and every perfect gift '
                        'is from above, coming down from the father \n  of lights '
                        'with whom there is no variation or shadow due to '
                        'change.',
                        18: '18.Of his own will he brought us forth by the '
                        'word of truth that we should be a kind of \n  first '
                        'fruits of his creatures.',
                        19: '19.Know this, my beloved brethren. Let every man '
                        'be quick to hear, slow to speak, \n  slow to anger,',
                        20: '20.for the anger of man does not work the '
                        'righteousness of God.',
                        21: '21.Therefore put away all filthiness and rank '
                        'growth of wickedness and receive \n  with meekness the '
                        'implanted word, which is able to save your souls.',
                        22: '22.But be doers of the word, and not hearers '
                        'only, deceiving yourselves.',
                        23: '23.For if any one is a hearer of the word and '
                        'not a doer, he is like a man who \n  observes his '
                        'natural face in a mirror;',
                        24: '24.for he observes himself and goes away and at '
                        'once forgets what he was like.',
                        25: '25.But he who looks into the perfect law, the '
                        'law of liberty, and perserveres, \n  being no hearer '
                        'that forgets but a doer that acts, he shall be '
                        'blessed in his doing.',
                        26: '26.If any one thinks he is religious, and does '
                        'not bridle his tongue but deceives his \n  heart, this '
                        'man\'s religion is vain.',
                        27: '27.Religion that is pure and undefiled before '
                        'God and the Father is this: to visit orphans \n  and '
                        'widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself '
                        'unstained from the world.'}
