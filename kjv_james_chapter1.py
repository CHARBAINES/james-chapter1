                        'to the twelve tribes \n  which are scattered abroad, '
                        'greeting.', 
                        2: '2.My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into '
                        'divers temptations;', 
                        3: '3.Knowing this, that the trying of your faith '
                        'worketh patience.',
                        4: '4.But let patience have her perfect work, that '
                        'ye may be perfect and entire, \n  wanting nothing.',
                        5: '5.If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, '
                        'that giveth to all men liberally, \n  and unbraideth '
                        'not; and it shall be given him.',
                        6: '6.But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For '
                        'he that wavereth is like a wave \n  of sea driven with '
                        'the wind and tossed.',
                        7: '7.For let not that man think that he shall receive '
                        'any thing of the Lord.', 
                        8: '8.A doubleminded man is unstable in all his ways.',
                        9: '9.Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he '
                        'is exalted:',
                        10: '10.But the rich, in that he is made low: because as '
                        'the flower of the grass \n  he shall pass away.',
                        11: '11.For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning '
                        'heat, but it withereth the grass, \n  and the flower '
                        'thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it '
                        'perisheth: \n  so also shall the rich man fade away in '
                        'his ways.',
                        12: '12.Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: '
                        'for when he is tried, he shall \n  receive the crown of '
                        'life, which the Lord hath promised to them that '
                        'love him.',
                        13: '13.Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted '
                        'of God: for God cannot be tempted \n  with evil, neither '
                        'tempteth he any man:',
                        14: '14.But every man is tempted, when he is drawn '
                        'away of his own lust, and enticed.',
                        15: '15.Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth '
                        'forth sin: and sin, when it is finished; \n  bringeth '
                        'forth death.',
                        16: '16.Do not err, my beloved brethren.',
                        17: '17.Every good gift and every perfect gift is '
                        'from above, and cometh down from the \n  Father of '
                        'lights, with whom is no variableness, neither '
                        'shadow of turning.',
                        18: '18.Of his own will begat he us with the word '
                        'of truth, that we should be a kind of \n  firstfruits '
                        'of his creatures.',
                        19: '19.Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every '
                        'man be swift to hear, slow to speak, \n  slow to wrath.',
                        20: '20.For the wrath of man worketh not the '
                        'righteousness of God.',
                        21: '21.Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and '
                        'superfluity of naughtiness, and receive \n  with meekness '
                        'the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.',
                        22: '22.But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers '
                        'only, deceiving your own selves.',
                        23: '23.For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a '
                        'doer, he is like unto a man \n  beholding his natural '
                        'face in a glass:',
                        24: '24.For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, '
                        'and straightway forgetteth what \n  manner of man he was.',
                        25: '25.But whoso looketh into the perfect law of '
                        'liberty, and continueth therein, \n  he being not a '
                        'forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man '
                        'shall be \nblessed in his deed.',
                        26: "26.If any man among you seem to be religous, and "
                        "bridleth not his tongue, but \n  deceiveth his own heart, "
                        "this man\'s religion is vain.",
                        27: '27.Pure religion and undefiled before God and the '
                        'Father is this, To visit the \n  fatherless and widows '
                        'in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted '
                        'from the world.'}
