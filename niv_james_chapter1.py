                        'To the twelve tribes \n  scattered among the nations: Greetings',
                        2: '2.Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you '
                        'face trials of many kinds,',
                        3: '3.because you know that the testing of your faith '
                        'develops perserverance.',
                        4: '4.Perserverance must finish its work so that you '
                        'may be mature and complete, \n  not lacking anything.',
                        5: '5.If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, '
                        'who gives generously to all \n  without finding fault, '
                        'and it will be given to him.',
                        6: '6.But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, '
                        'because he who doubts is \n  like a wave of the sea, '
                        'blown and tossed by the wind.',
                        7: '7.That man should not think he will receive '
                        'anything from the Lord;',
                        8: '8.he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he '
                        'does.',
                        9: '9.The brother in humble circumstances ought to '
                        'take pride in his high position.',
                        10: '10.But the one who is rich should take pride in '
                        'his low position, because he \n  will pass away like a '
                        'wild flower.',
                        11: '11.For the sun rises with scorching heat and '
                        'withers the plant; its blossom falls \n  and its beauty '
                        'is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will fade '
                        'away even \n  while he goes about his business.',
                        12: '12.Blessed is the man who perserveres under '
                        'trial, because when he has stood the test, \n  he will '
                        'receive the crown of life that God has promised to '
                        'those who love him.',
                        13: '13.When tempted, no one should say, "God is '
                        'tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by \n  evil, '
                        'nor does he tempt anyone;',
                        14: '14.but each one is tempted when, by his own '
                        'evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.',
                        15: '15.Then, after desire has conceived, it gives '
                        'birth to sin; and sin, when it is \n  full-grown, '
                        'gives birth to death.',
                        16: "16.Don\'t be deceived, my dear brothers.",
                        17: '17.Every good and perfect gift is from above, '
                        'coming down from the Father of the \n  heavenly lights, '
                        'who does not change like shifting shadows.',
                        18: '18.He chose to give us birth through the word '
                        'of truth, that we might be a kind of \n  firstfruits '
                        'of all he created.',
                        19: '19.My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone '
                        'should be quick to listen, \n  slow to speak and slow to '
                        'become angry,',
                        20: '20.for man\'s anger does not bring about the '
                        'righteous life that God desires.',
                        21: '21.Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the '
                        'evil that is so prevalent and \n  humbly accept the word '
                        'planted in you, which can save you.',
                        22: '22.Do not merely listen to the word, and so '
                        'deceive yourselves. Do what it says.',
                        23: '23.Anyone who listens to the word but does not '
                        'do what it says is like a man who looks \n  at his face '
                        'in a mirror',
                        24: '24.and, after looking at himself, goes away and '
                        'immediately forgets what he looks like.',
                        25: '25.But the man who looks intently into the '
                        'perfect law that gives freedom, and continues \n  to do '
                        'this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing '
                        'it - he will be blessed in \n  what he does.',
                        26: '26.If anyone considers himself religious and yet '
                        'does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, \n  he deceives '
                        'himself and his religion is worthless.',
                        27: '27.Religion that God our Father accepts as pure '
                        'and faultless is this: to look after \n  orphans and '
                        'widows in their distress and to keep oneself from '
                        'being polluted by the world.'}
